This module contains test functions for the file-IO functions
for reading and writing data sets using the netCDF file format.

The files read and written using this function are assumed to 
conform to the format specified for x-ray computed microtomorgraphy
data collected at Argonne National Laboratory, Sector 13, GSECars.
