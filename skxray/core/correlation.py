    Parameters
    ----------
    num_levels : int

        the depth of the binomial tree of averaged frames

    num_bufs : int, must be even
        maximum lag step to compute in each generation of
        downsampling

    labels : array
        labeled array of the same shape as the image stack;
        each ROI is represented by a distinct label (i.e., integer)

    images : iterable of 2D arrays
        dimensions are: (rr, cc)
